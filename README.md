# DistlerCorpus
_Lucas Hofmann, Craig S. Sapp, \& Fabian C. Moss_

We present **DistlerCorpus**, a corpus of Hugo Distler's _Der Jahrkreis_ op. 5 (1933), a collection of 52 predominantly three-voice motets. The corpus is provided in Humdrum, MusicXML and MIDI formats. The creation of the data set addresses Distler's distinctive notational treatment of polymeter: voice-specific time signatures and the resulting non-aligned barlines, combined with frequent homometric meter changes.
